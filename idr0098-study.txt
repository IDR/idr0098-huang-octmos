Study Description	The incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has increased in recent years, while it remains as an understudied subject. Current methods for the diagnose of skin cancer are either invasive, present a low resolution, or images that are difficult to interpret. Full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT) has proven its potential as a non-invasive imaging technique of epithelial tissue. The sub-micrometer resolution offered by FF-OCT is able to show fine features such as cell nuclei, blood vessels, and fibrous structures in the dermis. However, not many physicians are familiar with the images derived from this technique. Using a well-known mouse model of SCC, we acquired volumetric data from skin samples at different stages of the disease using our home-made FF-OCT system. We present OCT-Mouse Skin (OCT-MoS) dataset, a curated dataset of 3400 annotated tomograms distributed into four classes, representing different stages in the development of SCC: normal, dysplasia, papilloma, and SCC. This dataset has a high potential for reuse in areas such as cancer research, medical training, image processing, and deep learning.

Experiment Number	1																																
Comment[IDR Experiment Name]	idr0098-huang-octmos/experimentA	


Experiment Sample Type	tissue																															
Experiment Description	Abdominal skin from FVB/N mice was untreated to serve as control samples for the normal class. Back skin from FVB/N mice was treated with immunosupresant and tumor promoter solutions to study different stages of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. All samples were excised and imaged by full-field optical coherence tomography.

Assay Experimental Conditions	The skin of abdomen was not subject to stress conditions. The skin of back was treated with an immunosupressant solution (100ug of Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) dissolved into 0.2mL of acetone) at the beginning of the experiment and a tumor promoter (25mg of 12-OTetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in 100mL of ethanol) was applied every week.

Protocol Description	Mice were kept in cages and fed regularly.	The abdominal skin of the mice was left untreated. The back skin of the mice were treated with an immunosupressant solution (100ug of Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) dissolved into 0.2mL of acetone) at the beginning of the experiment and a tumor promoter (25mg of 12-OTetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in 100mL of ethanol) was applied every week	All images corresponding to normal tissue come from abdominal skin. Tissue from the back skin was classified as dysplasia if it looked inflamed, but not comming from warts. Tissue from wrats on the back skin was classified as papilloma. Tissue coming from warts bigger than 5mm on the back skin was classified as squamous cell carcinoma.
